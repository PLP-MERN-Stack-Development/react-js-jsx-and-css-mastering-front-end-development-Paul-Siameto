      Hi! I’m a passionate web developer who enjoys building interactive and user-friendly 
      applications. This Task Manager project showcases my skills in React, Tailwind CSS, 
      and state management using hooks and context. I love solving problems through clean 
      code and thoughtful design, and I’m always eager to learn and explore new technologies.
